Computer usage in the oil industry has progressed to the point where every engineer should be familiar with calculation procedures that can be applied to his work. This knowledge will allow him to evaluate the procedures published in the literature and determine the advantages and disadvantages of using a computer to do a certain job. In petroleum engineering work computers have been used to solve problems in:

surface separation;

primary reservoir performance;

pressure maintenance and secondary recovery operations;

gas-field operations including retrograde behavior, cycling, deliverability, gas plant operations, gas pipeline operations and compressor requirements;

economics;

maximizing profits or minimizing costs;

statistical analysis; and

general engineering practices such as drilling, casing design, compressor design and log interpretation.
